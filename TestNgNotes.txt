TestNG Notes:
It is annotation based framework
@Test is main annotation which makes our method as test.
It gives us additional features such as priorities of test cases, parameters, reports etc.

Annotations:
@Test - we write every function with this annotation for execution in testng
@BeforeMethod - we use this annotation for pre conditions which executes before every function
@AfterMethod -  we use this annotation for post conditions which executes after every function
@BeforeClass - we use this annotation for the condition we want to execute in the beginning of class
@AfterClass -  we use this annotation for the condition we want to execute in the end of class
